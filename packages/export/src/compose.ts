 * What tells two exports apart.
 *
 * Compose derives a volume's real name from the project name, and the project
 * name used to be the platform's own — so two exports of a tool called the
 * same thing got the same volume and, silently, the same database. That was
 * not a problem while data lived in ./data next to the compose file, because
 * two folders could not be the same folder. A named volume has no folder, so
 * the export has to carry the distinction itself.
 *
 * Made once, at export time, and written into the file: `docker compose down`
 * and `up` in the same folder must come back to the same work, and only a new
 * export should start empty.

/**
 * The file the recipient runs.
 *
 * Four choices in here are deliberate and easy to get wrong later.
 *
 * The published port is bound to 127.0.0.1, not to every interface. The
 * platform has no login: anything that can reach the port can read and write
 * everyone's work. Inside the container it listens on every interface because
 * that is the only way the mapping can reach it, so this line is the entire
 * access boundary.
 *
 * Data is a named volume, and the project name carries a unique id so that two
 * exports of a platform with the same name cannot end up sharing it. Both
 * halves were learned the hard way — see the named-volume note below and
 * newId above.
 *
 * credentials.json is mounted only when there is one. Compose creates a
 * *directory* where a bind mount source is missing, so an unconditional line
 * would leave every credential-free platform with a puzzling empty folder.
 *
 * The agreement service is a second container, and only appears when the
 * pipeline uses it. It stays in Go because it is agreement statistics that
 * already exist and work; the platform reaches it over the compose network, so
 * it is never published on the host at all.
