# Builds every image a platform needs, from this commit, under one version.
#
#   ./script/docker-build.sh            builds :dev
#   ./script/docker-build.sh 0.1.0      builds :0.1.0
#   ./script/docker-build.sh 0.1.0 push builds and pushes all three
#
# All three carry the same version, because the composer writes its own version
# into every export and the export pulls the other two by that tag. A composer
# at 0.1.0 shipping exports that pull a 0.0.9 platform is exactly the drift the
# old single-binary design ruled out by construction, so this script is what
# replaces it. Build them together or not at all.
#
# lawnotation-iaa lives in its own repository — it is the only Go left in the
# product — so this builds it from a sibling checkout. Without one, the version
# cannot be released: an export naming an image nobody can pull is worse than
# no release.
