// Host bindings — the runtime's side of each module's data-access contract.
//
// Two things are separated here, and keeping them separate is what lets one set
// of packages build very different platforms:
//
//   the port type says WHAT data flows        (corpus@1, annotated-task@1)
//   the pipeline's kind says WHERE it lives   (ephemeral / persistent)
//   the binding says HOW the module gets it   (a source built either way)
//
// A module declares only the first two of those — its ports and the contract it
// wants — and never learns which kind it is running in. That is not a
// convention this project invented: legal-annotation-kit ships createBulkSource
// "for hosts with no backend to save to" alongside createLazySource "for hosts
// with an external backend". The packages already say the host decides.
//
// So a binding is keyed by contract, and each contract has one implementation
// per mode. A new module reusing an existing contract needs nothing here at all;
// a genuinely new kind of module needs one file, which is the honest cost of a
// new kind of module.
